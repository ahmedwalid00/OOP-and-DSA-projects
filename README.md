# OOP and DSA Projects

This repository contains a collection of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) projects. The projects aim to implement various systems and algorithms using C++ and Python. The code is organized by different types of projects, including banking systems, management systems, games, and basic data structure algorithms.

## Projects Included

- **ATM System**: A simple ATM system with deposit, withdrawal, and balance check features.
- **Bank System**: A system for managing bank accounts with features like deposit, withdrawal, and account information display.
- **Staff Management System**: A system for managing staff records, including adding, updating, and deleting staff members.
- **Student Records Management**: A project to manage student records with functionalities for adding and updating student information.
- **Tic Tac Toe Game**: A classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game.
- **To-Do List**: A task management system where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **University System**: A system for managing university courses, students, and grades.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: C++, Python
- **Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees), Algorithms (e.g., Sorting, Searching) , design patterns.
